In this post I list all the programs and configurations I use for my development workflow. I favor a terminal centric approach in the tools I use as I consider it to be the most efficient way to work.

## Tools

- Code editor: [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- Shell: [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) and [spacefish](https://github.com/matchai/spacefish)
- Terminal emulator: [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig)

## Optional

- Command line finder: [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Command line color scheme: [Gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh)
- Vim browser extension: [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)

## Alternatives

- Tmux
- Github-desktop
- Vscode
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
- zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) theme

## Configuration
