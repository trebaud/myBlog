One of the cool stuff that comes with Neovim is its integrated terminal emulator. In this short blog post I will share how I use Neovim&amp;rsquo;s terminal and how you can configure it to make it easier to use.
First install Neovim on your system, for that follow the official guide instructions here.</description></item><item><title>My dev setup</title><link>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/dev-config/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/dev-config/</guid><description>In this post I list all the programs and configurations I use for my development workflow. I favor a terminal centric approach in the tools I use as I consider it to be the most efficient way to work.
Tools Code editor: Neovim with vim-plug Shell: fish with oh-my-fish and spacefish Terminal emulator: kitty tig Optional Command line finder: fzf Command line color scheme: Gogh Vim browser extension: Vimium Alternatives Tmux Github-desktop Vscode i3 zsh with oh-my-zsh and spaceship theme Configuration Here you can find the different configuration files I use for the various tools listed above.</description></item><item><title>Implementing a Merkle tree in Python</title><link>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/merkle-tree/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/merkle-tree/</guid><description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the past few years you have probably heard of Bitcoin, the decentralized, peer-to-peer, public, trustless, cash system protocol. Regardless of whether or not you think bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s current valuation is in a bubble or worse that it&amp;rsquo;s a Ponzi scheme, it&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the protocol solves a real and old problem in distributed computing, a.k.a the Byzantine&amp;rsquo;s General Problem. One of the underlying data structures ensuring the immutability of the blockchain is the Merkle tree.</description></item><item><title>Typing Python with typing</title><link>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/typing-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/typing-python/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big fan of the Python programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s great for prototyping, it has great libraries for data processing and machine learning and it&amp;rsquo;s overall just a joy to read and write with. But I also like types and if you&amp;rsquo;re at all familiar with the language then you know that variables are dynamically typed in Python and that type information is absent from the basic syntax.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://trebaud.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trebaud.github.io/about/</guid><description>üëã Hi I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer currently based in Montreal.
