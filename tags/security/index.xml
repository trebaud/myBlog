If you recently tried adding a new linux source repository in Ubuntu 22.04, then you might have seen this warning mesage:
Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)). Apt-key is a sub-command of apt used to manage asymmetric encryption keys in order to authenticate packages. It was found some time ago to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks (see CVE-2011-3374). Now it has finally been deprecated and will be deleted at some point in the future.</description></item><item><title>Owning your own Bug Bounty program</title><link>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/bug-bounty-management-101/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 18:22:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://trebaud.github.io/posts/bug-bounty-management-101/</guid><description>
Bug bounties (BB) are rapidly becoming an essential part of the modern security toolkit for most companies. And for good reason, they provide a cost effective way of exposing your application to a potentially vast range of experts and catch security holes that would otherwise take time and effort to find.
From experience unless you have a dedicated team working full time on security, most bugs uncovered by internal teams are done so in a serendipitous way.</description></item></channel></rss>
